# MetaGPT: Quelloffen

Quelloffen, a fully automated alarm clock and timer, is powered by Metagpt - a multi-agent collaboration framework built upon advanced large language models (LLMs). It boasts versatile timing modes including incremental, continuous, and segmented recording, and the ability to fetch real-time clock data and set alarms. This project exemplifies the remarkable capability of large models in independently handling timing and scheduling tasks.

We are deeply grateful for the framework provided by metagpt, and hereby enclose the GitHub address of metagpt for your further reference and usage: https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT
